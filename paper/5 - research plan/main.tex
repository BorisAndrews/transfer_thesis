    \BA{Introduction.}

    \BA{Look at tokamak-like models: Local flux surface models, symmetric solutions, funky BCs etc.}

    \BA{Test the low-noise PiC ideas with a simply Navier--Stokes model first.}
    
    \BA{I'm creating these structure-preserving timesteppers for the MHD component, but that falls down for now when I coupled it to the particles- is there any way I can avoid that? Does the FET approach help? Really interesting question.}
    
    \BA{What have I/others done so far, and what is there now to do.}

    \BA{Flowchart!}
