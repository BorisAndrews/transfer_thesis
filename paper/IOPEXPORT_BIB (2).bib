  title = {Non-Dimensional Scaling of Turbulence Characteristics and Turbulent Diffusivity},
  journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
  abstract = {Plasma turbulence characteristics, including radial correlation lengths, decorrelation times, amplitude profile and flow velocity, have been measured during a ρ* scan on DIII-D while all other transport relevant dimensionless quantities (e.g., β, ν*, κ, q, Te/Ti) are held nearly constant. The turbulence is measured by examining the correlation properties of the local long wavelength (k⊥ρi ⩽ 1) density fluctuations, measured with beam emission spectroscopy. The radial correlation length of the turbulence Lc,r is shown to scale with the local ion gyroradius, Lc,r  ≈ 5ρi, while the decorrelation times scale with the local acoustic velocity as τc∼a/cs. The turbulent diffusivity parameter, D∼(Lc,r2/τc), scales in a roughly gyro-Bohm-like fashion, as predicted by the gyrokinetic equations governing turbulent transport. The experimental one fluid power balance heat diffusivity scaling and that from GLF23 modelling compare reasonably well.},
