\section{Pseudo-Particle Generation/Elimination}
    The PiC algorithm here depends on modeling pseudo-particles only when needed, i.e. only when kinetic effects are large and the distibution functions, $f_{\pm}$, are far from thermalization, $f_{\pm}^{(0)}$. This requires pseudo-particles---in a numerical sense, objects from a class of pseudo-particles---to be:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Generated when required, i.e. constructed as computational objects.
        \item  Eliminated when not required, i.e. destructed as computational objects.
    \end{itemize}
    The latter, pseudo-particle elimination, shall be discussed here first.
