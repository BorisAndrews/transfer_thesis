\subsection*{Gyroaveraged Particle Pusher}
    We consider now a gyrokinetic expansion for the stochastic particle motion/pusher.
    
    \BA{Brief overview of classical gyrokinetic theory: Gyrokinetic expansions for classical particle motion/pushers well studied since bla bla bla [Ref, Ref, Ref, ...]. Have a deterministic particle ODE- listed below. High-frequency oscillation motivates multiscale expansion. Energy and moments bla bla bla. Drifts bla bla bla. Such an asymptotic expansion can be done to arbitrary accuracy, giving a complete model for the particle motion to arbitrary accuracy in a pre-determined EM field. Problem however lies in the fact that EM field is \emph{not} pre-determined- particles themselves generate EM fields, and particles themselves move. Thus, particle-on-particle effects occur which are harder to model in the gyrokinetic expansion---analogous to the the nonlinear component of the collision operator---causing a problem for the physical accuracy of full gyrokinetic PiC models for the whole plasma. This is referred to as gyrokinetic turbulence. [Ref, Ref, Ref, ...]}

    \BA{Extension to stochastic gyrokinetic model: Nonlinear component of collision operator no longer present $\implies$ don't need to worry about particle-on-particle effects- instead this manifests as the new stochastic terms in the particle pushers from the \emph{linearized} collision operator. Similar DEs can be derived in energy/moments/gyrocentres etc., except now with the introduction of stochastic effects- they are now \emph{SDEs}, not just \emph{ODEs}.}
