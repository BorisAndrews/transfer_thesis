\subsection{Numerical Particle Pushers}
    \BA{Have restructured this section. Need to check that references to this section are still correctly labelled.}

    (\ref{eqn:particle motion SDE}--\ref{eqn:particle forcing SDE}) give the \emph{continuous} SDE system that a pseudo particle in the kinetic phase model must satisfy (under the LÃ©nard--Bernstein collision operator assumption). For discretization, these must be converted...
