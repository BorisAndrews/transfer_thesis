\section{Stochastic Pseudo-Particle Motion and Pushers}\label{cha:particle motion}
    This section outlines the derivation of the SDEs satisfied by pseudo-particles in a Monte Carlo model of (\ref{eqn:linearized Boltzmann equation simplified}), and the subsequent stochastic particle pushers for their numerical simulation.
