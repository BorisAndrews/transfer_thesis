    \BA{Talk about gyrokinetic model:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  The model's physical basis/mathematics. (Equations provide good insight into the origin of some behavioural effects, e.g. gyro-orbits/drifts.)
        \item  Why we don't use it on the general kinetic equation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  High mathematical (more terms in lower dimensions doesn't necessarily mean faster computation)/computational (really don't want to do a 5D simulation) complexity.
            \item  Errors from neglection of terms. (Non-physical behaviour over long times/resonances and adiabatic invariants can be lost.)
        \end{itemize}
        \item  We \emph{will} however use it for the PIC correction.
    \end{itemize}}
