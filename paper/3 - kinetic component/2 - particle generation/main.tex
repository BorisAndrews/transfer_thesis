\section{Pseudo-Particle Generation/Elimination}\label{cha:particle generation}
    The PiC algorithm here depends on modeling pseudo-particles only when needed, i.e. only when kinetic effects are large and the distribution functions, $f_{\pm}$, are far from thermalization, $f_{\pm}^{(0)}$. This requires pseudo-particles (in a computational sense, objects generated from a pseudo-particles class) to be:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Generated when required, i.e. constructed as computational objects, as determined by the inhomogeneous RHS of (\ref{eqn:linearized Boltzmann equation simplified 1}), $\calF_{\pm}$.
        \item  Eliminated when no longer required, i.e. destructed as computational objects, as determined by the addition of a mollifying term to the collision operator approximation.
    \end{itemize}
    The latter, pseudo-particle elimination, shall be discussed here first.

    \begin{remark}[SP with particle generation/elimination]
        Both the generation and elimination of particles potentially cause difficulties for exact SP, as each particle introduces its own mass, momentum and energy to the plasma. This is a problem of which I am aware, but have yet to tackle.
    \end{remark}
