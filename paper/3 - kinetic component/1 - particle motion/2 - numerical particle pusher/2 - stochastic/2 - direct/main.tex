\paragraph*{Direct Discretization}
    \begin{remark}[Incoroporating stochastic effects into the SP direct particle pushers]
        Unlike in the stochastic gyrokinetic model, no new SDEs require derivation when incorporating the stochastic terms into a direct discretization. The main question here lies in how the stochastic terms are incorporated into the timestepper to give good SP properties.
        
        Since, however, I have yet to confirm what the target SDEs for e.g. the evolution of the energy and motion of the gyrocenter \emph{are}, I have not yet begun to approach this question.
    \end{remark}
