\subsubsection{Stochastic Particle Pushers}
    These classical particle pusher ideas can thus be built on to incorporate the stochastic collisional forces in the stochastic neoclassical transport equations (\ref{eqn:stochastic neoclassical transport 1}--\ref{eqn:stochastic neoclassical transport 2}).

    \begin{remark}[Application of FET to SDEs]
        FET seems like the ideal language for deriving timesteppers in the presence of stochastic terms. Take, for example, the canonical Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process,
        \begin{equation}
            \rmd X  =  - \nu X\rmd t + \sigma dW,
        \end{equation}
        for constant parameters $\nu$, $\sigma$, where $W$ is a Wiener process. ``Testing'' this equation against some (sufficiently smooth) test function $\phi$ on the timestep $T^{n}$, one requires
        \begin{equation}
            \int_{T^{n}}\phi\frac{\rmd}{\rmd t}X  =  - \nu\int_{T^{n}}\phi X + \sigma\left(\left(\phi|_{t^{n + 1}}W|_{t^{n + 1}} - \phi|_{t^{n}}W|_{t^{n}}\right) - \int_{T^{n}}W\frac{\rmd}{\rmd t}\phi\right).
        \end{equation}
        This final stochastic term from the Wiener process is a quantifiable random variable. In the case of constant $\phi = 1$ for example,
        \begin{equation}
            \left(\phi|_{t^{n + 1}}W|_{t^{n + 1}} - \phi|_{t^{n}}W|_{t^{n}}\right) - \int_{T^{n}}W\frac{\rmd}{\rmd t}\phi
            =  W|_{t^{n + 1}} - W_{t^{n}},
        \end{equation}
        which obeys a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\delta t^{n}$.

        I have yet to explicitly derive timesteppers for the stochastic neoclassical transport equations, as I would like to know more about both SP timesteppers in the deterministic case and numerical techniques for the modeling of SDEs in general first. It does strike me as promising however that SDEs fit so neatly into the framework of FET-derived timesteppers.
    \end{remark}
