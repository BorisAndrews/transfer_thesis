\subsection{Discretization (Particle Pushers)}
    (\ref{eqn:stochastic neoclassical transport 1}--\ref{eqn:stochastic neoclassical transport 2}) give the stochastic neoclassical transport equations that a pseudo-particle in the kinetic component of the hybrid model would ideally satisfy in the \emph{continuous} case. For numerical simulation, this must be discretized, characterizing the particle pusher.
