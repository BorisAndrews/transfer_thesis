\subsubsection{Deterministic (Classical) Particle Pushers}
    To discretize the stochastic neoclassic transport model (\ref{eqn:stochastic neoclassical transport 1}--\ref{eqn:stochastic neoclassical transport 2}), consider first classical discretization techniques for the deterministic neoclassical transport model (\ref{eqn:deterministic neoclassical transport 1}--\ref{eqn:deterministic neoclassical transport 2}).
    
    Since this system exhibits prominent multiscale behavior, discretizations on the longer transport timescale that accurately capture the particle dynamics induced by oscillation on the shorter cyclotron timescale are non-trivial. There are 2 common approaches, using numerical ODE/SDE discretization techniques on either:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Pseudo-particle parameters that are invariant (up to leading order) over cyclotron-frequency oscillations, in a gyroaveraged discretization.
        \item  $\bfX_{\pm}^{(i)}$ and $\bfV_{\pm}^{(i)}$, in what is refereed to here as a \emph{``direct''} discretization.
    \end{itemize}
    Each approach has its own benefits and weaknesses.
