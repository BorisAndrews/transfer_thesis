\subsection{Variational Formulation}
    \BA{Introduction.}
    
    To apply the finite element method, one must first cast the model (\ref{eqn:current identity}â€“\ref{eqn:Gauss's law}) into a chosen variational form, by asserting that its inner product, in this case under the $L^{2}$ norm, is equal to $0$ upon integration by all function in some chosen function space, in this case ones derived from $\calD$, $\cdots$, $\calB$.

    \BA{What was the name for weak formulations where the test spaces don't equal the solution spaces? Hmmmmm. I should mention that though!}
