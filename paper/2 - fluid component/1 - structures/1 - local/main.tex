\subsection*{Local Structures}
    Arguably the most crucial local structure in the MHD system is Gauss's law, $\nabla\cdot\bfB  =  0$. Enforced on the ICs at $t  =  0$, this can be seen to be preserved for $t  >  0$, this can be seen to be conserved by Faraday's law, $\partial_{t}\bfB  =  - \nabla\wedge\bfE$, by taking the divergence, from the complex property $\rmdiv\circ\bfcurl  =  0$: \cite{Stratton_1941, Rosen_1980, Freist√ºhler_Warnecke_2002}
    \begin{align}
                    \partial_{t}\bfB   &=  - \nabla\wedge\bfE  \\
        \nabla\cdot[\partial_{t}\bfB]  &=  - \mst{\nabla\cdot[\nabla\wedge\bfE]}  \\
        \partial_{t}[\nabla\cdot\bfB]  &=  0  \\
                     \nabla\cdot\bfB   &=  0
    \end{align}
    To the authors' knowledge, the preservation of Gauss's law in finite-element discretizations of MHD using FEEC was first studied by Hu et al. in \cite{Hu_Xu_2015, Hu_Ma_Xu_2017}.

    \begin{remark}
        In the incompressible system, the mass conservation/incompressibility constraint $\nabla\cdot\bfu  =  0$ can be viewed as a conserved structure. This does not immediately however carry over to the \emph{compressible} system.
