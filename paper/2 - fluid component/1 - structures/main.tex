\section{Structures in the Compressible MHD System}\label{cha:structures}
    Before constructing a finite-element discretization of the MHD system in Figure \ref{fig:compressible strong form}, consider first those local/global structures that are conserved/dissipated by the MHD system. We intend to construct finite-element timesteppers that preserves these structures:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  ``Local'' structures here refer to those that exist pointwise in $\bfOmega$, i.e. those that are functions of $\bfOmega$, $t$.
        \item  ``Global'' structures here refer to those that are defined via integrals over $\bfOmega$, i.e. those that are functions of $t$ only.
    \end{itemize}

    \BA{(Why do we care about this?)}
