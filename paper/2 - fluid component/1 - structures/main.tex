\section{Structures in the Compressible MHD System}\label{cha:structures}
    Before constructing a finite-element discretization of the MHD system in Figure \ref{fig:compressible strong form}, consider first those local/global quantities that are conserved/dissipated by the MHD system. We intend to construct finite-element timesteppers that preserves these structures.
