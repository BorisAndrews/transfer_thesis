\section{Analysis: Linearization and Well-Posedness}\label{cha:analysis}
    \begin{remark}
        Here I want to work towards the problem as will be solved in a finite element simulation by showing (or at least considering when) the linearized problem (or perhaps a reduced, Picard linearization) is well-posed, particularly with regard to the regularity required by each of the function spaces.
        
        This is another question I've yet to begin to approach, especially since I'm not sure of the discretization I want to consider.
    \end{remark}
