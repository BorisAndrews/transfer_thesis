\section{Analysis: Linearization and Well-Posedness}\label{cha:analysis}
    \begin{remark}[Linearization and well-posedness]
        Here I want to work towards the problem as will be solved in a finite element simulation by showing (or at least considering when) the linearized problem (or perhaps a reduced, Picard linearization) is well-posed, particularly with regard to the regularity required by each of the function spaces.
        
        This is another question I have yet to begin to approach, especially since I am not sure of the discretization I want to consider.
    \end{remark}
