\section{Ensuring Structure Preservation in Weak/Variational Formulations}
    When constructing timesteppers for systems with conserved/dissipated quantities, it is natural to seek ones that preserve these conservational/dissipative structures. There are many reasons one might seek to do this:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  {\bf Qualitative motivations:} The physical origins for such quantities often imply important qualitative interpretations, such as the topology of the magnetic poential characterised by the magnetic helicity as discussed above. Discretization that violate these structure can subsequently be exhibit correspondingly unphysical behavior.
        \item  {\bf Quantiative motivations:} By way of example, the conservation of global quantities can often provide useful bounds on the outputs of the timesteppers, which can be useful in proving many results, such as well-posedness. The conservation of local quantities can alternatively help in providing parameter-robust bounds for convergence results, or allow the modification of the equations without fear of modification of the numerical results, such as in the use of augmented Lagrangians. \cite{FMW19, LFM22}
    \end{itemize}
    Whatever the motivation, it is logical to ensure the constructed timestepper preserved these structures.

    Consider then, a general time-dependent PDE (or system of PDEs) in the generic strong form
    \begin{equation}\label{eqn:general time-dependent PDE}
        \bfzero  =  \bfF\!\left[\bfu, \nabla\bfu, \nabla^{2}\bfu, \cdots; \partial_{t}\bfu\right]\!(\bfx; t),
    \end{equation}
    alongside appropriate boundary conditions (BCs). The physical origins of such systems often imply the existence of certain functionals $\rmE[\bfu](t)$ that are conserved/dissipated over time, e.g. such that $\forall  t$ either $\frac{\rmd}{\rmd t}\rmE  =  0$, $\frac{\rmd}{\rmd t}\rmE  \leq  0$, or $\frac{\rmd}{\rmd t}\rmE  =  \calO[\epsilon]$ for some parameter $\epsilon \ll 1$.

    Other than the energies and helicities considered above for the compressible MHD system, other classical examples one might consider include:
    \begin{example}[Heat equation]
        The heat equation,
        \begin{equation}\label{eqn:heat equation}
            \partial_{t}u  =  \frac{1}{\rmPe}\Delta u,
        \end{equation}
        under homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann BCs, where the energy $\rmE(t)  :=  \int_{\bfOmega}u^{2}$ is dissipated according to
        \begin{equation}\label{eqn:heat equation dissipation}
            \frac{\rmd}{\rmd t}\rmE  =  - \frac{1}{\rmPe}\|\nabla u\|^{2}  \leq  0.
        \end{equation}
    \end{example}
    
    \begin{example}[Hamiltonian systems]
        Hamiltonian systems with Hamiltonian $\calH[p|_{t}, q|_{t}](t)$:
        \begin{align}
            \partial_{t}p  =  - \nabla_{q|_{t}}\calH,  &&
            \partial_{t}q  =  + \nabla_{p|_{t}}\calH,
        \end{align}
        for $L^{2}$ functional derivatives $\nabla_{p|_{t}}$, $\nabla_{q|_{t}}$, on $\bbR^{d}$, which exactly conserve the Hamiltonian,
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\rmd}{\rmd t}\calH  =  0,
        \end{equation}
        such as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  The wave equation,
            \begin{align}
                \partial_{t}v  =  c^{2}\Delta u,  &&
                \partial_{t}u  =  v,
            \end{align}
            from the Hamiltonian
            \begin{equation}
                \calH(t)  :=  c^{2}\|\nabla u\|_{\bfOmega}^{2} + \|v\|_{\bfOmega}^{2}.
            \end{equation}
            \item  The Schr√∂dinger equation,
            \begin{equation}
                i\hbar\partial_{t}\Psi  =  \left[- \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\Delta + V\right]\Psi,
            \end{equation}
            or, from $\Psi  =  q + ip$,
            \begin{align}
                \partial_{t}p  =  - \frac{1}{\hbar}\left[- \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\Delta + V\right]q,  &&
                \partial_{t}q  =  + \frac{1}{\hbar}\left[- \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\Delta + V\right]p,
            \end{align}
            from the Hamiltonian
            \begin{equation}
                \calH(t)  :=  \frac{1}{\hbar}\int_{\bfOmega}\left[\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left(\|\nabla p\|^{2} + \|\nabla q\|^{2}\right) + V\left(p^{2} + q^{2}\right)\right],
            \end{equation}
            or
            \begin{equation}
                \calH(t)  :=  \frac{1}{\hbar}\int_{\bfOmega}\left[\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\|\nabla\Psi\|^{2} + V|\Psi|^{2}\right].
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{example}

    To apply the the finite-element method (FEM) to such a system, it must be cast into a weak/variational form.
