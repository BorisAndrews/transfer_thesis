\subsection*{The \emph{Compressible} Case}
    \begin{remark}[SP discretizations for the compressible MHD model]
        I would like to consider now the compressible MHD model as defined in Figure \ref{fig:compressible strong form}. There is, however, a lot of work in this, and I would first like to be sure in the approach I am taking for the compressible NS, since the compressible MHD formulation will likely follow a very similar architecture. In particular, Gawlik and Gay--Balmaz approach the problem of constructing SP timesteppers for compressible MHD in \cite{Gawlik_Gay--Balmaz_2021,Gawlik_Gay--Balmaz_2022} by discretizing the Lagrangian, which seems a promising alternative approach.
        
        While I do have some ideas building on my ideas for the incompressible \emph{MHD} model and the \emph{compressible} NS model, I am going to leave the problem of constructing SP timestepper for \emph{compressible MHD} for future work, for now.
    \end{remark}
