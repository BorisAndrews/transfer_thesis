    \BA{Introduction.}
    
    Techniques for the numerical solution of the MHD equations have been very well developed over recent years however \BA{([Ref, Ref, Ref, Ref, Ref, â€¦])}. The question therefore lies in how these more efficient techniques, can be reapplied to the more accurate kinetic models, when the two are so qualitatively different.

    \BA{...whereby through some approximation to the 2-particle distribution functions, the collision terms, $(\bfC_{ss'})_{ss'}$, are written in terms of the 1-particle distribution functions, $(f_{s})_{s}$.}

    \BA{Would like to consider an expansion of the collision operator of the form
    \begin{multline}
        \bfC_{s}  =  \left[f_{s}\rho_{s'}(\bfmu_{ss'}(\bfu_{s'} - \bfv) + \nabla_{\bfx}\cdot[\bftau_{ss'}({\bf sym}(\nabla_{\bfx}\bfu_{s}))] + \cdots)\right]  \\
        + \nabla_{\bfv}\cdot\left[f_{s}\rho_{s'}(\bfD_{ss'}(\bfu_{s'} - \bfv) + \cdots)\right] + \cdots
    \end{multline}}
    
    \BA{I have some inconsistency in notation here with the rest of the paper in how I donate integrals. I should make this consistent, by denoting $\int_{\bfx}  \mapsto  \int_{\bfOmega}$ and, say, $\int_{\bfv}  \mapsto  \int_{\bfXi}$.}
    
    \BA{Change my $\rho_{M}$'s and $\rho_{C}$'s to $\rho_{\rmM}$'s and $\rho_{\rmC}$'s.}
