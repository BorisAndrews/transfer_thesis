\section{System of Equations}
    \BA{Introduction.}

    \BA{Introduce class of valid collision operator approximation.}

    \BA{Also wanna talk about the model I'll be using here:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Stationary-state vs. Periodic vs. Timestepper
        \item  Global (whole tokamak) vs. Local (flux tubes)
    \end{itemize}}

        \BA{Might instead just do a remark about first considering Navier--Stokes in the further work subsectionn.}
