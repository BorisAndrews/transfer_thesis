    \section*{Summary}
        We discuss the meaning behind $\delta\!f$ models, and the motivation for using a coupled FEM/PiC numerical model for the simulation of the components.
        
        There exists one notable problem posed by the combination of these numerical techniques. The FEM approach for the fluid component was chosen in part due to the advantages of FEM in producing exactly structure-preserving MHD discretizations. The non-determinstic approach for the kinetic component may threaten this property, however. This will be discussed further in Chapter \ref{cha:research plan}.
