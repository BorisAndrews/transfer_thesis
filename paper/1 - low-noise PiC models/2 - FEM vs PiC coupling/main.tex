\section{FEM vs. PiC Coupling}
    $\delta\! f$ models induce both a fluid (\ref{eqn:PiC-coupled mass conservation}--\ref{eqn:PiC-coupled pressure conservation}) and a kinetic component (\ref{eqn:linearized Boltzmann equation}) that require numerical solution. Each of these two components then offers a choice of possible numerical techniques.

    \BA{Proposition: FEM on fluid background + PiC on kinetic correction.}

    \BA{Why do the two work together?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Weak formulations from FEM/FET provide work really nice with testing against the delta-function (weak) approximations to the correction provided by PiC. Give example of resultant equations when testing against a compactly-supported smooth test function. (Talk here about testing against stochastic processes- eek.)
        \item  FET gives meaning to the time derivatives in the fluid parameters, so we can have a much nicer closed form for the inhomogeneous RHS in the kinetic equation.
        \item  On the other hand, stochastic models throw a spanner in the works of necessary exact structure preservation.
    \end{itemize}}

    \BA{So, idea is: compressible Hall MHD model with forcing/heating provided by particles + gyroaveraged stochastic particles that appear when kinetic effects are prominent with motion guided by the MHD model. Could do a new diagram, or make this is more clearly annotated on my star-like coupling diagram.}
