\subsection*{Kinetic Component (\ref{eqn:linearized Boltzmann equation})}
    The kinetic component comprises an inhomogeneously linear, conservative PDE in position space, $\bfx$, and velocity space, $\bfv$. Classical techniques for the numerical solution of conservative PDEs include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Monte Carlo--like Lagrangian pseudo-particle techniques\footnote{To be able to derive a pseudo-particle model from such a kinetic equation, certain conditions must be satisfied by the collision operator. This will be discussed further in Subsection \ref{cha:collision operators}.}
        \item  Classical Eulerian techniques (FEM/FDM/etc.)
    \end{itemize}
    For these equations, the former particle-in-cell (PiC) approach has many benefits over classical PDE techniques: \BA{(Michael Barnes disagrees, so I'd be interested to hear his reasoning.)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  {\bf Particle decoupling from non-linearity:} Whereas in traditional PiC models, the pseudo-particles interact directly with one another through a distinct EM field---analogous to nonlinear collision operators in the Boltzmann equations (\ref{eqn:Boltzmann equation})---pseudo-particle techniques for the linearized Boltzmann equations require no such coupling, due to the equations' linearity. Particles interact indirectly \emph{through} the fluid component. (See Figure \ref{fig:PiC decoupling})

        This both:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Reduces the number of component-to-coupling information couplings from $\calO[n^{2}]$, in a classical direct PiC method, to $\calO[n]$, where $n$ is the number of particles in the pseudo-particle layer.
            \item  Eases the application of gyroaveraging techniques, without needing a distinct handling for gyrokinetic turbulence effects. For a further discussion see Subsection \ref{cha:gyroaveraging}.
        \end{itemize}

        \item  {\bf Infinite velocity domain:} Lagrangian techniques are preferable under such conditions since---while classical Eulerian techniques for the solution of PDEs over infinite velocity domains exist \BA{[Ref, Ref, ....]}---Lagrangian techniques require no separate decision and analysis, which can often be relatively arbitrary.

        \item  {\bf Non-local collision operators:} Hand-in-hand with the advantages for infinite velocity domains comes the advantages posed by PiC methods for linearized (local) collision operators, $\partial\bfC_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}^{(0)}$, that are non-local in velocity space, $\bfv$. Due to their ability to model both small- and large-angle collisions, non-local collision operators, such as fractional Laplacian models \cite{Cho_2015, Sakomoto_2016, Kiselev_Schmalian_2019} or those derived directly from the molecular chaos hypothesis from classical kinetic theory \cite{Lerner_Trigg_1991}, serve some of the most fundamental and accurate collision operator models in thermodynamics. \BA{(Good place for a little literature review on non-local/fractional Laplacian collision operators.)}
        
        Non-local terms pose a huge problem for traditional Eulerian PDE techniques, which rely on the PDE's locality for the creation of sparse, parallelizable matrix solves. This is not a problem for particle models however, where the non-locality manifests simply as a stochastic process with occasional larger-amplitude jumps in the velocity.

        By way of example, consider the following non-local, fractional PDE for a reduced (spatially-homogeneous, non-dimensionalized) kinetic model in $f(v; t)$, where $v  \in  \bbR$ is a 1-dimensional (1D) particle velocity--like parameter,
        \begin{equation}\label{eqn:reduced Boltzmann equation}
            \partial_{t}f  =  - \mu\partial_{v}f - |c\partial_{v}|^{\alpha}f,
        \end{equation}
        for some:
        \begin{align*}
            \alpha  \in  (0, 2],  &&
            c       >    0,       &&
            \mu     \in  \bbR.
        \end{align*}
        This is the Fokker Planck--type PDE satisfied by the probability density function (PDF) of a skew-free 1D Lévy flight \cite{Chechkin_et_al_2008} with:
        \begin{align*}
            \text{Stability parameter: } \alpha,  &&
            \text{scale parameter: } c,           &&
            \text{location parameter: } \mu.
        \end{align*}
        Its solution can therefore be modeled numerically through the use of a collection of pseudo-particles with velocity $v  =  V(t)$, each evolving according to the same Lévy flights. Example simulations of such flights for varying $\alpha$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Levy flight examples}. The increased non-locality of the operator for smaller $\alpha$ can be seen to manifest as an increased frequency of visibly larger jumps at smaller $\alpha$.

        To quantify why these jumps appear for smaller $\alpha$, consider an example such psseudo-particle with initial velocity $V(0)  =  v_{0}$. The PDF for its position at time $\tau  >  0$, $V(\tau)$, is given by the Lévy $\alpha$-stable distribution \cite{Lévy_1925, Mandelbrot_1960} with:
        \begin{align*}
            \text{Stability parameter: } \alpha,            &&
            \text{scale parameter: } \sqrt[\alpha]{\tau}c,  &&
            \text{location parameter: } v_{0)} + \tau\mu.
        \end{align*}
        Equivalently, for initial conditions (ICs) $f|_{t = 0}  =  \delta[v - v_{0}]$ where $\delta$ is the 1D $\delta$ function, the solution $f|_{t = \tau}$ to (\ref{eqn:reduced Boltzmann equation}) at time $t = \tau$ is given by the same distribution. These large jumps can be interpreted as the manifestation of the tail behavior of these distributions, with heavier tails for smaller $\alpha$:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  As $|v|  \rightarrow  \infty$, \cite{Nolan_2020}
            \begin{equation}
                f|_{t = \tau}  \sim  \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + 1)c^{\alpha}}{\pi}\sin\left(\frac{\pi\alpha}{2}\right)\tau|v|^{- 1 - \alpha}.
            \end{equation}
            \item  For $\alpha  <  2$, the moments $\bbE\left[|V(\tau)|^{\theta}\right]$ exist \emph{only} for $\theta  <  \alpha$.
        \end{itemize}

        These collision operators will be discussed further in Subsection \ref{cha:collision operators}.
        
        \item  {\bf Regions of high and low thermalization:} Pseudo-particle methods need only model the function where it is non-zero. Similarly, for functions that exhibit certain regions of comparatively large and small values, pseudo-particle methods can inherently focus more computational processing power to those regions of larger value, and less to those regions of smaller value.
        
        For plasmas, one might expect different regions where the plasma:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Largely thermalized and kinetic effects are \emph{less} prominent, i.e. where $f_{\pm}$ are \emph{closer} to $f_{\pm}^{(0)}$ and $\delta\!f_{\pm}$ are correspondingly \emph{smaller} (e.g. in the plasma core).
            \item  Further from thermalization and kinetic effects are \emph{more} prominent, i.e. where $f_{\pm}$ are \emph{further} to $f_{\pm}^{(0)}$ and $\delta\!f_{\pm}$ are correspondingly \emph{larger} (e.g. close to a beam injection device, or near the reactor walls).
        \end{itemize}
        Pseudo-particle methods can use this to their computational advantage, where classical PDE techniques cannot.
    \end{itemize}
