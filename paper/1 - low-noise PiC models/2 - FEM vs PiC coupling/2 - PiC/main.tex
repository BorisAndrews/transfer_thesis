\subsection*{Kinetic Component (\ref{eqn:linearized Boltzmann equation}): PiC}
    The kinetic component comprises an inhomogeneously linear, conservative PDE in position space, $\bfx$, and velocity space, $\bfv$. Classical techniques for the numerical solution of conservative PDEs include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Monte Carlo--like Lagrangian pseudo-particle/particle-in-cell (PiC) techniques
        \item  Classical Eulerian techniques (FEM/FDM/etc.)
    \end{itemize}
    For these equations, the former PiC approach has many benefits over classical PDE techniques:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  {\bf Particle decoupling from linearity:} Whereas in traditional PiC models, the pseudo-particles interact directly with one another through a distinct EM field---analogous to nonlinear collision operators in the Boltzmann equations (\ref{eqn:Boltzmann equation})---pseudo-particle techniques for the linearized Boltzmann equations require no such coupling, due to the equations' linearity. Particles interact indirectly, via the fluid component. (See Figure \ref{fig:PiC decoupling})

        This both:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Reduces the number of component-to-component information couplings from $\calO[n^{2}]$, in a classical direct PiC method, to $\calO[n]$, where $n$ is the number of particles in the pseudo-particle layer.
            \item  Eases the application of gyroaveraging techniques, without needing a distinct handling for collisions. For a further discussion see Subsection \ref{cha:particle pushers}.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item  {\bf Infinite velocity domain:} Lagrangian techniques are preferable under such conditions. While classical Eulerian techniques for the solution of PDEs over infinite velocity domains exist---within FEM for example, see \cite{Fix_Strang_1969, Strang_Fix_2011, Babuška_1972}---Lagrangian techniques require no separate decision and analysis, which can often be relatively arbitrary.

        \item  {\bf Non-local collision operators:} Hand-in-hand with the advantages for infinite velocity domains comes the advantages posed by PiC methods for linearized (local) collision operators, $\partial\bfC_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}^{(0)}$, that are non-local in velocity space, $\bfv$. Due to their ability to model both small- and large-angle collisions, non-local collision operators, such as fractional Laplacian models \cite{Cho_2015, Sakomoto_2016, Kiselev_Schmalian_2019} or those derived directly from the molecular chaos hypothesis from classical kinetic theory \cite{Lerner_Trigg_1991}, serve some of the most fundamental and accurate collision operator models in thermodynamics.
        
        Non-local terms pose a huge problem for traditional Eulerian PDE techniques, which rely on the PDE's locality for the creation of sparse, parallelizable matrix solves. This is not a problem for particle models however, where the non-locality can manifest simply as a stochastic process, with occasional larger-amplitude jumps in the velocity.

        By way of example, consider the following non-local, fractional PDE for a reduced (spatially-homogeneous, non-dimensionalized) kinetic model in $f(v; t)$, where $v  \in  \bbR$ is a 1-dimensional (1D) particle velocity--like parameter,
        \begin{equation}\label{eqn:reduced Boltzmann equation}
            \partial_{t}f  =  - \mu\partial_{v}f - |c\partial_{v}|^{\alpha}f,
        \end{equation}
        for some:
        \begin{align*}
            \alpha  \in  (0, 2],  &&
            c       >    0,       &&
            \mu     \in  \bbR.
        \end{align*}
        This is the Fokker Planck--type PDE satisfied by the probability density function (PDF) of a skew-free 1D Lévy flight \cite{Chechkin_et_al_2008} with:
        \begin{align*}
            \text{stability parameter: } \alpha,  &&
            \text{scale parameter: } c,           &&
            \text{location parameter: } \mu.
        \end{align*}
        Its solution can therefore be modeled numerically through the use of a collection of pseudo-particles with velocity $v  =  V(t)$, each evolving according to the same Lévy flights. Example simulations of such flights for varying $\alpha$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Levy flight examples}. The increased non-locality of the operator for smaller $\alpha$ can be seen to manifest as an increased frequency of visibly larger jumps.

        To quantify why these jumps appear for smaller $\alpha$, consider an example such pseudo-particle with initial velocity $V(0)  =  v_{0}$. The PDF for its position at time $\tau  >  0$, $V(\tau)$, is given by the Lévy $\alpha$-stable distribution \cite{Lévy_1925, Mandelbrot_1960} with:
        \begin{align*}
            \text{stability parameter: } \alpha,            &&
            \text{scale parameter: } \sqrt[\alpha]{\tau}c,  &&
            \text{location parameter: } v_{0} + \tau\mu.
        \end{align*}
        Equivalently, for initial conditions (ICs) $f|_{t = 0}  =  \delta[v - v_{0}]$ where $\delta$ is the 1D $\delta$ function, the solution $f|_{t = \tau}$ to (\ref{eqn:reduced Boltzmann equation}) at time $t = \tau$ is given by the same distribution. These large jumps can be interpreted as the manifestation of the tail behavior of these distributions, with heavier tails for smaller $\alpha$:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  As $|v|  \rightarrow  \infty$, \cite{Nolan_2020}
            \begin{equation}
                f|_{t = \tau}  \sim  \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + 1)c^{\alpha}}{\pi}\sin\left(\frac{\pi\alpha}{2}\right)\tau|v|^{- 1 - \alpha}.
            \end{equation}
            \item  For $\alpha  <  2$, the moments $\bbE\left[|V(\tau)|^{\theta}\right]$ exist \emph{only} for $\theta  <  \alpha$.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item  {\bf Regions of high and low thermalization:} Pseudo-particle methods need only model the function where it is largely non-zero. Similarly, for functions that exhibit certain regions of comparatively large and small values, pseudo-particle methods can inherently focus more computational power to those regions of larger $\delta\!f_{\pm}$, and less to those regions of smaller $\delta\!f_{\pm}$.
        
        For plasmas, one might expect different regions where the plasma is:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Largely thermalized and kinetic effects are \emph{less} prominent, i.e. where $f_{\pm}$ are \emph{closer} to $f_{\pm}^{(0)}$ and $\delta\!f_{\pm}$ are correspondingly \emph{smaller} (e.g. in the plasma core).
            \item  Further from thermalization and kinetic effects are \emph{more} prominent, i.e. where $f_{\pm}$ are \emph{further} to $f_{\pm}^{(0)}$ and $\delta\!f_{\pm}$ are correspondingly \emph{larger} (e.g. close to a beam injection device, or near the reactor walls).
        \end{itemize}
        Pseudo-particle methods can use this to their computational advantage, where classical PDE techniques cannot.
    \end{itemize}
