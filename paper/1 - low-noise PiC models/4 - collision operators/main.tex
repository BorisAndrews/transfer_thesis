\section{Collision Operators Models}\label{cha:collision operators}
    Since it is relevant in both the fluid and kinetic component of the $\delta\!f$ decomposition model, we consider now our choice of collision operator model.

    \begin{definition}[Lénard--Bernstein (LB) collision operators]\label{def:LB collision operators}
        In the notation of this thesis, LB collision operator models $\bfC_{ss'}^{\rm LB}$ are those composed of a drift and a diffusion term,
        \begin{equation}\label{eqn:LB operator}
            \bfC_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}^{\rm LB}  =  \nu_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}\rho_{\pm_{2}}f_{\pm_{1}}(\bfv - \bfu_{\pm_{2}}) + \nabla_{\bfv}\left[\nu_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}D_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}\rho_{\pm_{2}}f_{\pm_{1}}\right],
        \end{equation}
        for drift and diffusion constants $\nu_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}$, $D_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}$ respectively, potentially functions of the fluid parameters, where $\rho_{\pm}$, $\bfu_{\pm}$ denote the phase-specific densities and velocities:
        \begin{align}
            \rho_{\pm}  :=                      \int_{\bfv}f_{\pm},  &&
            \bfu_{\pm}  :=  \frac{1}{\rho_{\pm}}\int_{\bfv}f_{\pm}\bfv.
        \end{align}
    \end{definition}

    \line

    For a model for the local collision operators $\bfC_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}^{(0)}$ to be valid, it must satisfy the constraints of Lemma \ref{lem:phase-restricted conservation on local collision operators}. Using LB operators $\bfC_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}^{(0)}  =  \bfC_{\pm_{1}\pm_{2}}^{\rm LB}$ one requires:
    \begin{align}
               \nu_{+-}  =  \nu_{-+},  &&
             D_{\pm\pm}  =  \theta_{\pm},  &&
        D_{+-} + D_{-+}  =  (\theta_{+} + \theta_{-}) + \frac{1}{3}\|\bfu_{+} - \bfu_{-}\|^{2},
    \end{align}
    where similarly $\theta_{\pm}$ denote the phase-specific temperatures,
    \begin{equation}
        \theta_{\pm}  :=  \frac{1}{3\rho_{\pm}}\left(\int_{\bfv}f_{\pm}\|\bfv\|^{2} - \rho_{\pm}\|\bfu_{\pm}\|^{2}\right).
    \end{equation}

    \begin{remark}[Non-local collision operators]
        I would like to consider non-local collision operators including fractional derivatives as proposed in Section \ref{cha:FEM vs. PiC}, but it is tough getting them to satisfy the conditions Lemma \ref{lem:phase-restricted conservation on local collision operators}. I have got reason to expect them not to be able to do so either, as the Lévy flights and the Lévy stable distributions with stability parameter $< 2$ corresponding to those fractional collision operators have unbounded second moments, which naturally corresponds to the particle energy.

        For the rest of this thesis, I will be working with the LB collision operator model, and leave the consideration of further collision operator models for another time.
    \end{remark}
