    \begin{abstract}
        Magnetic confinement reactors---in particular tokamaks---offer one of the most promising options for achieving practical nuclear fusion, with the potential to provide virtually limitless, clean energy. The theoretical and numerical modeling of tokamak plasmas is simultaneously an essential component of effective reactor design, and a great research barrier. Tokamak operational conditions exhibit comparatively low Knudsen numbers. Kinetic effects, including kinetic waves and instabilities, Landau damping, bump-on-tail instabilities and more, are therefore highly influential in tokamak plasma dynamics. Purely fluid models are inherently incapable of capturing these effects, whereas the high dimensionality in purely kinetic models render them practically intractable for most relevant purposes.

        We consider a $\delta\!f$ decomposition model, with a macroscopic fluid background and microscopic kinetic correction, both fully coupled to each other. A similar manner of discretization is proposed to that used in the recent {\tt STRUPHY} code \cite{Holderied_Possanner_Wang_2021, Holderied_2022, Li_et_al_2023} with a finite-element (FE) model for the background and a pseudo-particle/PiC model for the correction.

        The fluid background satisfies the full, non-linear, resistive, compressible, Hall MHD equations. \cite{Laakmann_Hu_Farrell_2022} introduces finite-element(-in-space) implicit timesteppers for the incompressible analogue to this system with structure-preserving (SP) properties in the ideal case, alongside parameter-robust preconditioners. We show that these timesteppers can derive from a finite-element-in-time (FET) (and finite-element-in-space) interpretation. The benefits of this reformulation are discussed, including the derivation of timesteppers that are higher order in time, and the quantifiable dissipative SP properties in the non-ideal, resistive case.
        
        We discuss possible options for extending this FET approach to timesteppers for the compressible model.

        The kinetic corrections satisfy linearized Boltzmann equations. Using a Lénard--Bernstein collision operator, these take Fokker--Planck-like forms \cite{Fokker_1914, Planck_1917} wherein pseudo-particles in the numerical model obey the neoclassical transport equations, with particle-independent Brownian drift-diffusion terms. This offers a rigorous methodology for incorporating collisions into the particle transport model, without coupling the equations of motions for each particle.
        
        Particle pushers for the collisionless neoclassical transport equations that preserve important structures from the gyrokinetic model were developed by Chen, Chacón et al. in \cite{Chen_Chacón_Barnes_2011, Chacón_Chen_Barnes_2013, Chen_Chacón_2014, Chen_Chacón_2015}. We consider how these too might derive from a FET interpretation, similarly offering potential extensions to higher-order-in-time particle pushers. Stochastic gyrokinetic expansions are also discussed, with the intent to develop stochastic particle pushers also via FET that preserve these stochastic gyrokinetic structures.

        Options for and potential difficulties that might be posed by the numerical implementation of these schemes are considered.

        Due to the efficacy of FET in the development of SP timesteppers for both the fluid and kinetic component, we hope this approach will prove effective in the future for developing timesteppers for the full hybrid model with powerful SP properties. We hope this will give us the opportunity to incorporate previously inaccessible kinetic effects into the highly effective, modern, FE MHD models.
