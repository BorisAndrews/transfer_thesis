    \BA{Introduction.}

    \BA{One thing I need to generally do is scan through to find any times I have used ``-ise'' and change them to ``-ize''- a good habit! :( Also should do the same for ``modelling'' to ``modeling'', as well as ``behaviour'' to ``behavior'' (or pretty much anything as suggested by Grammarly).}

    \BA{Check I have introduced (once and only once) the abbreviations I used.}

    \BA{Change my $q_{s}$'s and $m_{s}$'s (and $*_{\pm}$'s etc.) to $\rmq_{s}$'s and $\rmm_{s}$'s.}
    
    \BA{Remove all "we"s and "us"s? Passive voice?}

    \BA{Check my notation when introducing new terminology---\emph{``*''} vs. ``*''---is consistent.}

    \BA{Did I ever say what ``SDE'' stands for? Or ``ODE''/``PDE''/``DE''? Should just make an abbreviations subsection at the start!}

    \BA{Should make sure I am including good literature reviews throughout the thesis.}

    \BA{Talk about results we might expect to find- best to do this throughout the thesis too.}

    \BA{Other topics to note mentioned on the transfer thesis requirements.}
