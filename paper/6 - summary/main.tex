    \BA{Introduction.}

    \BA{One thing I need to generally do is scan through to find any times I've used ``-ise'' and change them to ``-ize''- a good habit! :( Also should do the same for ``modelling'' to ``modeling'', as well as ``behaviour'' to ``behavior'' (or pretty much anything as suggested by Grammarly).}

    \BA{Check I've introduced (once and only once) the abbreviations I used.}
    
    \BA{Remove all "we"s and "us"s- passive voice!}
    
    \BA{Change my $\rho_{M}$'s and $\rho_{C}$'s to $\rho_{\rmM}$'s and $\rho_{\rmC}$'s.}

    \BA{Should make sure I'm including good literature reviews throughout the thesis.}

    \BA{Talk about results we might expect to find- best to do this throughout the thesis too.}

    \BA{Other topics to note mentioned on the transfer thesis requirements.}
