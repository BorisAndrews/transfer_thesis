    \BA{One thing I need to generally do is scan through to find any times I've used ``-ise'' and change them to ``-ize''- a good habit! :( Also should do the same for ``modelling'' to ``modeling'', as well as ``behaviour'' to ``behavior'' (or pretty much anything as suggested by Grammarly).}

    \section*{Summary}
        Tokamak-like conditions put the numerical modeling of plasmas a fundamental difficulty for numerical modeling:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Fluid models often fail to accurately capture crucial effects in the dynamics of tokamak plasmas.
            \item  Kinetic models require a high dimensionality that can render them computationally intractable.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \BA{Summary.}
        
        \BA{Need a compromise between fluid and kinetic models.}
