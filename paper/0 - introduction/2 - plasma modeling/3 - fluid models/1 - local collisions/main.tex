\subsubsection*{Assumption 1: Leading-Order Locality of the Collision Operators}
    Fluid models consider scales wherein the dominant collisional effects are local in space and time. \BA{(On what scales?)} When viewed as functionals on $(f_{s}, f_{s'})$, it is assumed that $(\bfC_{ss'})_{ss'}$ are dominated by the local contributions of $(f_{s}, f_{s'})$ at each $\bfx$ and $t$; \BA{(Not sure about this phrasing...)} that is to say that, up to leading order,
    \begin{equation}\label{eqn:local collision operator}
        \bfC_{ss'}[f_{s}, f_{s'}](\bfx, \bfv; t)  \sim  \bfC_{ss'}^{(0)}[f_{s}|_{\bfx; t}, f_{s'}|_{\bfx; t}](\bfv)
    \end{equation}
    for some $(\bfC_{ss'}^{(0)})_{ss'}$. Define $\bfC_{ss'}  = 
     \bfC_{ss'}^{(0)} + \bfdelta\bfC_{ss'}$, such that $(\bfdelta\bfC_{ss'})_{ss'}$ capture the non-local, viscous collisional effects.
    
    This extends the results of Lemma \ref{lem:conservation on collision operators}:

    \begin{lemma}[Momentum and energy conservation on $(\bfC_{ss'}^{(0)})_{ss'}$]\label{lem:conservation on local collision operators}
        The following two identities hold on $(\bfC_{ss'}^{(0)})_{ss'}$:
        \begin{align}
            \sum_{s, s'}\rmq_{s}\rmq_{s'}\int_{\bfv}\bfC_{ss'}^{(0)}           \sim  \bfzero,  &&
            \sum_{s, s'}\rmq_{s}\rmq_{s'}\int_{\bfv}\bfC_{ss'}^{(0)}\cdot\bfv  \sim  0.
        \end{align}
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        By Lemma \ref{lem:conservation on collision operators}:
        \begin{align}
            \int_{\bfx}\left[\sum_{s, s'}\rmq_{s}\rmq_{s'}\int_{\bfv}\bfC_{ss'}^{(0)}\right]           \sim  \bfzero,  &&
            \int_{\bfx}\left[\sum_{s, s'}\rmq_{s}\rmq_{s'}\int_{\bfv}\bfC_{ss'}^{(0)}\cdot\bfv\right]  \sim  0.
        \end{align}
        Since $(\bfC_{ss'}^{(0)})_{ss'}$ are local in space, the only way for this integral identity necessarily to hold is if it holds pointwise in space, for each $\bfx$.
    \end{proof}
