    \begin{definition}[Fluid model]\label{def:fluid model}
        Here, ``fluid'' models refer to those wherein the system is reduced from one in \emph{both} position and velocity space (and time) to one in \emph{just} position space (and time) through some kind of approximation to the distribution function.
    \end{definition}

    Recall the Boltzmann equation (\ref{eqn:Boltzmann equation}):
    \begin{equation*}
        \partial_{t}f_{s} + \nabla_{\bfx}\cdot[f_{s}\bfv] + \frac{\rmq_{s}}{\rmm_{s}}\nabla_{\bfv}\cdot[f_{s}(\bfE + \bfv\wedge\bfB)]  =  \frac{\rmq_{s}}{\rmm_{s}}\sum_{s'}\rmq_{s'}\nabla_{\bfv}\cdot\bfC_{ss'}.
    \end{equation*}
    
    Using some approximations to the \emph{2}-particle distribution functions, $(f_{ss'})_{ss'}$, as functions of the \emph{1}-particle distribution functions, $(f_{s}, f_{s'})_{ss'}$, suppose from here the collision operators, $(\bfC_{ss'})_{ss'}$, are written as functions of the 1-particle distribution functions,
    \begin{equation}
        \bfC_{ss'}[f_{s}, f_{s'}](\bfx, \bfv; t).
    \end{equation}
    This quantifies the collision operator model, bringing a solution to the closure problem. Most often, these 2-particle distribution function approximations are defined implicitly through the collision operator approximation.
