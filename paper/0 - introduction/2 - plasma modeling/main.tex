\section*{Plasma, Tokamak Plasma and Tokamak Edge Plasma Modeling: Theory and Simulation}
    \BA{Introduction.}

    At its heart, a plasma is a fluid, albeit a multiphase, electrically-charged one. Constructing a plasma model therefore follows the same workflow as that of constructing a model for a typical single phase, non-electrically-charged fluid. Many of the assumptions that we would traditionally make when deriving traditional fluid model such as the Navierâ€“Stokes equations (such as in particular the dominance of collisions in the Boltzmann equation \BA{[Ref]}) fail in the case of (tokamak) plasmas however. It makes sense therefore to return to the fundamentals, and construct our model from the ground up.
