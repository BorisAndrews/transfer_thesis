\subsection*{What is a Plasma?}

    \begin{definition}[Plasma]
        ``Plasma'' refers here to an electrically charged fluid, typically occurring when a fluid is supplied with sufficient energy—from heating or an applied electromagnetic (EM) field—that a significant portion of the atoms \BA{(Not molecules?)} are ionised \BA{(Terminology?)}, causing the (positive) ion and (negative) electron phases to move independently.
    \end{definition}

    Plasma is one of the most abundant forms of matter in the universe \cite{CL13}, found most frequently in stars \cite{Phi95, Asc06, Pie17} and similarly—as in our case—the star-like environments emulated in a tokamak.
    
    While an applied EM field induces a current as it separates the two charged phases: the ions and electrons, the current similarly induces and EM field through Maxwell's equations, creating a complex, coupled, nonlinear system, referred to as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). \BA{[Ref.]}
