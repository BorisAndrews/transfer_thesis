\subsection*{Tokamak Plasmas: Symmetries, Structure and Edge Plasma Models}
    \BA{Complicated BCs in a tokamak.}

    \BA{Structure induced by symmetry/divertor (separatrix etc.).}

    \BA{Edge plasma- their physical behavior (good + bad curvature/drifts/turbulence etc.), and the models physicists use (local flux tubes etc.).}
