  abstract   = {Solar science has evolved rapidly over the past ten years as the results of a new generation of solar space missions have become available. This book provides a thorough introduction to the subject of solar physics, based on those spacecraft observations. The author introduces the solar corona, which has a temperature of several million degrees, and sets it in the context of basic plasma physics before moving on to discuss plasma instabilities and plasma heating processes. The latest results on coronal heating and radiation, which are fundamental processes in all stars, are presented. Spectacular phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections are described in detail, together with their potential effects on the Earth. The author draws together observations made at many wavelengths from hard X-rays, soft X-rays, extreme UV and radio wavelengths. This paperback study edition of Markus Aschwanden’s highly acclaimed Physics of the Solar Corona will include 50 pages of problems and solutions which will much enhance the value of the book to students.},

  abstract    = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) model an immense variety of physical phenomena of theoretical and practical interest, although they often do not present closed-form solutions. Firedrake is a high-performance, automated code generation software tool to approximate the solution to PDEs using the finite element method (FEM). Time-dependent PDEs are commonly solved numerically by applying the FEM only in the spatial-domain, reducing the problem to a number of time-dependent ordinary differential equations solved by time-stepping methods like Runge–Kutta. This report presents Fetsome, an extension to Firedrake and the Irksome time-stepping library which discretises the time domain through finite elements like in the spatial domain, providing a new software implementation for the mathematical formulation of finite element in time (FET). Fetsome supports continuous Petrov–Galerkin and discontinuous Galerkin time elements, which decouple the problem defined on the global timemesh to obtain local FET time-stepping. Code verification is performed through convergence testing for classical linear and nonlinear time dependent PDEs such as the heat, transport and Burgers' equations. By analysing the stability properties of solutions to the inviscid Burgers' equation, the efficacy of the implementation in combining with more complex spatial discretisations and flux functions is highlighted.},

  abstract = {The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations are generally known to be difficult to solve numerically, due to their highly nonlinear structure and the strong coupling between the electromagnetic and hydrodynamic variables, especially for high Reynolds and coupling numbers. In this work, we present a scalable augmented Lagrangian preconditioner for a finite element discretization of the B-E formulation of the incompressible viscoresistive MHD equations. For stationary problems, our solver achieves robust performance with respect to the Reynolds and coupling numbers in two dimensions and good results in three dimensions. We extend our method to fully implicit methods for time-dependent problems which we solve robustly in both two and three dimensions. Our approach relies on specialized parameter-robust multigrid methods for the hydrodynamic and electromagnetic blocks. The scheme ensures exactly divergence-free approximations of both the velocity and the magnetic field up to solver tolerances. We confirm the robustness of our solver by numerical experiments in which we consider fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers and coupling numbers up to 10,000 for stationary problems and up to 100,000 for transient problems in two and three dimensions.},

These equations incorporate the Hall current term in Ohm's law and provide a more appropriate description of fully ionized plasmas than the standard MHD equations on length scales close to or smaller than the ion skin depth. We introduce a stationary discrete variational formulation of Hall MHD that enforces the magnetic Gauss's law exactly (up to solver tolerances) and prove the well-posedness and convergence of a Picard linearization. For the transient problem, we present time discretizations that preserve the energy and magnetic and hybrid helicity precisely in the ideal limit for two types of boundary conditions. Additionally, we present an augmented Lagrangian preconditioning technique for both the stationary and transient cases. We confirm our findings with several numerical experiments.},

  shorttitle = {Plasma Physics},
  abstract   = {The enlarged new edition of this textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the basic processes in plasmas and demonstrates that the same fundamental concepts describe cold gas-discharge plasmas, space plasmas, and hot fusion plasmas. Starting from particle drifts in magnetic fields, the principles of magnetic confinement fusion are explained and compared with laser fusion. Collective processes are discussed in terms of plasma waves and instabilities. The concepts of plasma description by magnetohydrodynamics, kinetic theory, and particle simulation are stepwise introduced. Space charge effects in sheath regions, double layers and plasma diodes are given the necessary attention. The novel fundamental mechanisms of dusty plasmas are explored and integrated into the framework of conventional plasmas. The book concludes with a concise description of modern plasma discharges.Written by an internationally renowned researcher in experimental plasma physics, the text keeps the mathematical apparatus simple and emphasizes the underlying concepts. The guidelines of plasma physics are illustrated by a host of practical examples, preferentially from plasma diagnostics. There, Langmuir probe methods, laser interferometry, ionospheric sounding, Faraday rotation, and diagnostics of dusty plasmas are discussed. Though primarily addressing students in plasma physics, the book is easily accessible for researchers in neighboring disciplines, such as space science, astrophysics, material science, applied physics, and electrical engineering.This second edition has been thoroughly revised and contains substantially enlarged chapters on plasma diagnostics, dusty plasmas and plasma discharges. Probe techniques have been rearranged into basic theory and a host of practical examples for probe techniques in dc, rf, and space plasmas. New topics in dusty plasmas, such as plasma crystals, Yukawa balls, phase transitions and attractive forces have been adopted. The chapter on plasma discharges now contains a new section on conventional and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering. The recently discovered electrical asymmetry effect in capacitive rf-discharges is described.The text is based on an introductory course to plasma physics and advanced courses in plasma diagnostics, dusty plasmas, and plasma waves, which the author has taught at Kiel University for three decades. The pedagogical approach combines detailed explanations, a large number of illustrative figures, short summaries of the basics at the end of each chapter, and a selection of problems with detailed solutions.},
