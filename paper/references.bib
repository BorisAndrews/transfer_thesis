  journal   = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
  abstract  = {This paper presents a complete theoretical framework for studying turbulence and transport in rapidly rotating tokamak plasmas. The fundamental scale separations present in plasma turbulence are codified as an asymptotic expansion in the ratio ϵ = ρi/a of the gyroradius to the equilibrium scale length. Proceeding order by order in this expansion, a set of coupled multiscale equations is developed. They describe an instantaneous equilibrium, the fluctuations driven by gradients in the equilibrium quantities, and the transport-timescale evolution of mean profiles of these quantities driven by the interplay between the equilibrium and the fluctuations. The equilibrium distribution functions are local Maxwellians with each flux surface rotating toroidally as a rigid body. The magnetic equilibrium is obtained from the generalized Grad--Shafranov equation for a rotating plasma, determining the magnetic flux function from the mean pressure and velocity profiles of the plasma. The slow (resistive-timescale) evolution of the magnetic field is given by an evolution equation for the safety factor q. Large-scale deviations of the distribution function from a Maxwellian are given by neoclassical theory. The fluctuations are determined by the ‘high-flow’ gyrokinetic equation, from which we derive the governing principle for gyrokinetic turbulence in tokamaks: the conservation and local (in space) cascade of the free energy of the fluctuations (i.e. there is no turbulence spreading). Transport equations for the evolution of the mean density, temperature and flow velocity profiles are derived. These transport equations show how the neoclassical and fluctuating corrections to the equilibrium Maxwellian act back upon the mean profiles through fluxes and heating. The energy and entropy conservation laws for the mean profiles are derived from the transport equations. Total energy, thermal, kinetic and magnetic, is conserved and there is no net turbulent heating. Entropy is produced by the action of fluxes flattening gradients, Ohmic heating and the equilibration of interspecies temperature differences. This equilibration is found to include both turbulent and collisional contributions. Finally, this framework is condensed, in the low-Mach-number limit, to a more concise set of equations suitable for numerical implementation.}

The algorithm employs a kinetically enslaved Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) method, and conserves energy and charge to numerical round-off. In this study, we generalize the method to electromagnetic simulations in 1D using the Darwin approximation to Maxwell’s equations, which avoids radiative noise issues by ordering out the light wave. An implicit, orbit-averaged, time–space-centered finite difference scheme is employed in both the 1D Darwin field equations (in potential form) and the 1D-3V particle orbit equations to produce a discrete system that remains exactly charge- and energy-conserving. Furthermore, enabled by the implicit Darwin equations, exact conservation of the canonical momentum per particle in any ignorable direction is enforced via a suitable scattering rule for the magnetic field. We have developed a simple preconditioner that targets electrostatic waves and skin currents, and allows us to employ time steps O(mi/mec/veT) larger than the explicit CFL. Several 1D numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, performance, and conservation properties of the algorithm. In particular, the scheme is shown to be second-order accurate, and CPU speedups of more than three orders of magnitude vs. an explicit Vlasov–Maxwell solver are demonstrated in the “cold” plasma regime (where kλD≪1).}

  abstract = {For decades, the Vlasov–Darwin model has been recognized to be attractive for particle-in-cell (PIC) kinetic plasma simulations in non-radiative electromagnetic regimes, to avoid radiative noise issues and gain computational efficiency. However, the Darwin model results in an elliptic set of field equations that renders conventional explicit time integration unconditionally unstable. Here, we explore a fully implicit PIC algorithm for the Vlasov–Darwin model in multiple dimensions, which overcomes many difficulties of traditional semi-implicit Darwin PIC algorithms. The finite-difference scheme for Darwin field equations and particle equations of motion is space–time-centered, employing particle sub-cycling and orbit-averaging. The algorithm conserves total energy, local charge, canonical-momentum in the ignorable direction, and preserves the Coulomb gauge exactly. An asymptotically well-posed fluid preconditioner allows efficient use of large cell sizes, which are determined by accuracy considerations, not stability, and can be orders of magnitude larger than required in a standard explicit electromagnetic PIC simulation. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency properties of the algorithm with various numerical experiments in 2D–3V.}

  abstract = {This paper discusses a novel fully implicit formulation for a one-dimensional electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulation approach. Unlike earlier implicit electrostatic PIC approaches (which are based on a linearized Vlasov–Poisson formulation), ours is based on a nonlinearly converged Vlasov–Ampére (VA) model. By iterating particles and fields to a tight nonlinear convergence tolerance, the approach features superior stability and accuracy properties, avoiding most of the accuracy pitfalls in earlier implicit PIC implementations. In particular, the formulation is stable against temporal (Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy) and spatial (aliasing) instabilities. It is charge- and energy-conserving to numerical round-off for arbitrary implicit time steps (unlike the earlier “energy-conserving” explicit PIC formulation, which only conserves energy in the limit of arbitrarily small time steps). While momentum is not exactly conserved, errors are kept small by an adaptive particle sub-stepping orbit integrator, which is instrumental to prevent particle tunneling (a deleterious effect for long-term accuracy). The VA model is orbit-averaged along particle orbits to enforce an energy conservation theorem with particle sub-stepping. As a result, very large time steps, constrained only by the dynamical time scale of interest, are possible without accuracy loss. Algorithmically, the approach features a Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov solver. A main development in this study is the nonlinear elimination of the new-time particle variables (positions and velocities). Such nonlinear elimination, which we term particle enslavement, results in a nonlinear formulation with memory requirements comparable to those of a fluid computation, and affords us substantial freedom in regards to the particle orbit integrator. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the advertised properties of the scheme. In particular, long-time ion acoustic wave simulations show that numerical accuracy does not degrade even with very large implicit time steps, and that significant CPU gains are possible.}

It is hoped that the use of these procedures will result in a better understanding of the transport mechanisms and scaling in tokamaks. Another application of these algorithms is for the improvement of the numerical properties of the simulation plasma. For instance, implementations of such algorithms (1) enable us to suppress the intrinsic numerical noise in the simulation, and also (2) make it possible to regulate the weights of the fast-moving particles and, in turn, to eliminate the associated high frequency oscillations. Examples of their application to drift-type instabilities in slab geometry are given.

Comput., 28 (2006), pp. 2095--2113] a preconditioner of augmented Lagrangian type was presented for the two-dimensional stationary incompressible Navier--Stokes equations that exhibits convergence almost independent of Reynolds number. The algorithm relies on a highly specialized multigrid method involving a custom prolongation operator and for robustness requires the use of piecewise constant finite elements for the pressure. However, the prolongation operator and velocity element used do not directly extend to three dimensions: the local solves necessary in the prolongation operator do not satisfy the inf-sup condition. In this work we generalize the preconditioner to three dimensions, proposing alternative finite elements for the velocity and prolongation operators for which the preconditioner works robustly. The solver is effective at high Reynolds number: on a three-dimensional lid-driven cavity problem with approximately one billion degrees of freedom, the average number of Krylov iterations per Newton step varies from 4.5 at Re = 10 to 3 at Re = 1000 and 5 at Re = 5000.}

  abstract  = {Numerical analysis is a subject of extreme interest to mathematicians and computer scientists, who will welcome this first inexpensive paperback edition of a groundbreaking classic text on the subject. In an introductory chapter on numerical methods and their relevance to computing, well-known mathematician Richard Hamming (\&quot;the Hamming code,\&quot; \&quot;the Hamming distance,\&quot; and \&quot;Hamming window,\&quot; etc.), suggests that the purpose of computing is insight, not merely numbers. In that connection he outlines five main ideas that aim at producing meaningful numbers that will be read and used, but will also lead to greater understanding of how the choice of a particular formula or algorithm influences not only the computing but our understanding of the results obtained. The five main ideas involve (1) insuring that in computing there is an intimate connection between the source of the problem and the usability of the answers (2) avoiding isolated formulas and algorithms in favor of a systematic study of alternate ways of doing the problem (3) avoidance of roundoff (4) overcoming the problem of truncation error (5) insuring the stability of a feedback system. In this second edition, Professor Hamming (Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California) extensively rearranged, rewrote and enlarged the material. Moreover, this book is unique in its emphasis on the frequency approach and its use in the solution of problems. Contents include: I. Fundamentals and Algorithms II. Polynomial Approximation- Classical Theory Ill. Fourier Approximation- Modern Theory IV. Exponential Approximation ... and more Highly regarded by experts in the field, this is a book with unlimited applications for undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics, science and engineering. Professionals and researchers will find it a valuable reference they will turn to again and again.},

The implemented model features linear, ideal MHD equations in curved, three-dimensional space, coupled nonlinearly to the full-orbit Vlasov equations via a current coupling scheme. The algorithm is based on finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) for MHD and particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for the kinetic part; it provably conserves mass, energy, and the divergence-free magnetic field, irrespective of metric (= space curvature), mesh parameters and chosen order of the scheme. These properties enable reliable long-time simulations of energetic particle physics in complex geometries, covering the whole range of MHD waves. In STRUPHY, the finite element spaces are built from tensor products of univariate B-splines on the logical cuboid and can be made high-order by increasing the polynomial degree. Time-stepping is based on a skew-symmetric splitting with implicit sub-steps, mitigating CFL conditions from fast magneto-acoustic waves. High-order time splitting schemes can be used in this regard.}

  journal   = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract  = {Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is encountered in a wide variety of astrophysical plasmas, including accretion disks, the solar wind, and the interstellar and intracluster medium. On small scales, this turbulence is often expected to consist of highly anisotropic fluctuations with frequencies small compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. For a number of applications, the small scales are also collisionless, so a kinetic treatment of the turbulence is necessary. We show that this anisotropic turbulence is well described by a low-frequency expansion of the kinetic theory called gyrokinetics. This paper is the first in a series to examine turbulent astrophysical plasmas in the gyrokinetic limit. We derive and explain the nonlinear gyrokinetic equations and explore the linear properties of gyrokinetics as a prelude to nonlinear simulations. The linear dispersion relation for gyrokinetics is obtained, and its solutions are compared to those of hot-plasma kinetic theory. These results are used to validate the performance of the gyrokinetic simulation code GS2 in the parameter regimes relevant for astrophysical plasmas. New results on global energy conservation in gyrokinetics are also derived. We briefly outline several of the problems to be addressed by future nonlinear simulations, including particle heating by turbulence in hot accretion flows and in the solar wind, the magnetic and electric field power spectra in the solar wind, and the origin of small-scale density fluctuations in the interstellar medium.}

  abstract    = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) model an immense variety of physical phenomena of theoretical and practical interest, although they often do not present closed-form solutions. Firedrake is a high-performance, automated code generation software tool to approximate the solution to PDEs using the finite element method (FEM). Time-dependent PDEs are commonly solved numerically by applying the FEM only in the spatial-domain, reducing the problem to a number of time-dependent ordinary differential equations solved by time-stepping methods like Runge--Kutta. This report presents Fetsome, an extension to Firedrake and the Irksome time-stepping library which discretises the time domain through finite elements like in the spatial domain, providing a new software implementation for the mathematical formulation of finite element in time (FET). Fetsome supports continuous Petrov--Galerkin and discontinuous Galerkin time elements, which decouple the problem defined on the global timemesh to obtain local FET time-stepping. Code verification is performed through convergence testing for classical linear and nonlinear time dependent PDEs such as the heat, transport and Burgers' equations. By analysing the stability properties of solutions to the inviscid Burgers' equation, the efficacy of the implementation in combining with more complex spatial discretisations and flux functions is highlighted.},

For the transient problem, we present time discretizations that preserve the energy and magnetic and hybrid helicity precisely in the ideal limit for two types of boundary conditions.

In this work, we present a scalable augmented Lagrangian preconditioner for a finite element discretization of the B-E formulation of the incompressible viscoresistive MHD equations. For stationary problems, our solver achieves robust performance with respect to the Reynolds and coupling numbers in two dimensions and good results in three dimensions. We extend our method to fully implicit methods for time-dependent problems which we solve robustly in both two and three dimensions. Our approach relies on specialized parameter-robust multigrid methods for the hydrodynamic and electromagnetic blocks. The scheme ensures exactly divergence-free approximations of both the velocity and the magnetic field up to solver tolerances. We confirm the robustness of our solver by numerical experiments in which we consider fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers and coupling numbers up to 10,000 for stationary problems and up to 100,000 for transient problems in two and three dimensions.},

The radial correlation length of the turbulence Lc,r is shown to scale with the local ion gyroradius, Lc,r  ≈ 5ρi, while the decorrelation times scale with the local acoustic velocity as τc∼a/cs. The turbulent diffusivity parameter, D∼(Lc,r2/τc), scales in a roughly gyro-Bohm-like fashion, as predicted by the gyrokinetic equations governing turbulent transport.

Starting from particle drifts in magnetic fields, the principles of magnetic confinement fusion are explained and compared with laser fusion. Collective processes are discussed in terms of plasma waves and instabilities. The concepts of plasma description by magnetohydrodynamics, kinetic theory, and particle simulation are stepwise introduced. Space charge effects in sheath regions, double layers and plasma diodes are given the necessary attention. The novel fundamental mechanisms of dusty plasmas are explored and integrated into the framework of conventional plasmas. The book concludes with a concise description of modern plasma discharges.Written by an internationally renowned researcher in experimental plasma physics, the text keeps the mathematical apparatus simple and emphasizes the underlying concepts. The guidelines of plasma physics are illustrated by a host of practical examples, preferentially from plasma diagnostics. There, Langmuir probe methods, laser interferometry, ionospheric sounding, Faraday rotation, and diagnostics of dusty plasmas are discussed. Though primarily addressing students in plasma physics, the book is easily accessible for researchers in neighboring disciplines, such as space science, astrophysics, material science, applied physics, and electrical engineering.This second edition has been thoroughly revised and contains substantially enlarged chapters on plasma diagnostics, dusty plasmas and plasma discharges. Probe techniques have been rearranged into basic theory and a host of practical examples for probe techniques in dc, rf, and space plasmas. New topics in dusty plasmas, such as plasma crystals, Yukawa balls, phase transitions and attractive forces have been adopted. The chapter on plasma discharges now contains a new section on conventional and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering. The recently discovered electrical asymmetry effect in capacitive rf-discharges is described.The text is based on an introductory course to plasma physics and advanced courses in plasma diagnostics, dusty plasmas, and plasma waves, which the author has taught at Kiel University for three decades. The pedagogical approach combines detailed explanations, a large number of illustrative figures, short summaries of the basics at the end of each chapter, and a selection of problems with detailed solutions.},

Numerous worked examples provide motivation for and illustration of key ideas and show how to make the transition from theory to practice. Exercises are also provided to test and extend understanding: solutions for these are available for teachers.},

  journal  = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {A gauge-invariant and hence physically meaningful definition of magnetic helicity density for random fields is proposed, using the Gauss linking formula, as the density of correlated field line linkages. This definition is applied to the random small-scale field in weakly inhomogeneous turbulence, whose correlation length is small compared with the scale on which the turbulence varies. For inhomogeneous systems, with or without boundaries, our technique then allows one to study the local magnetic helicity density evolution in a gauge-independent fashion, which was not possible earlier. This evolution equation is governed by local sources (owing to the mean field) and by the divergence of a magnetic helicity flux density. The role of magnetic helicity fluxes in alleviating catastrophic quenching of mean field dynamos is discussed.}
