\subsection{Particle-in-Cell (PIC)?}
    \BA{Will Saunders at NEPTUNE said there's evidence that this decomposition gives a ``low-noise'' PIC simulation- quite what this means I don't know---potentially the reduction of high-wavenumber perturbations in the fluid portion? That's the impression I got off James Cook in his NEPTUNE presentation---\emph{however}, the key takeaway is there is \emph{solid evidence} that this is \emph{the way to go}. Just Google ``low-noise particle-in-cell'' and you find there's a \emph{solid} amount of literature on the idea.}
