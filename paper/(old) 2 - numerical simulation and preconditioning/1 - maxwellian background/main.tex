\section{Maxwellian Background: A Fluid Simulation}
    \BA{Important thing of note here is the fact that this is necessarily a \emph{compressible}, and therefore partially \emph{hyperbolic} system, which can cause a lot of difficulties for creating good discretisations and simulations. (C.F. Numerical dissipation.)}

    \BA{If we would like to use AL preconditioners \emph{and} FDM, then we need both:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Exact incompressibility, with $P \cong \nabla\cdot\bfU$ (up to some uniformly finite-dimensional nullspace).
        \item  Tensor product FE spaces.
    \end{itemize}
    There's 2 ways I see about this:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  A subcomplex of the higher-regularity, conforming $H^{1}(\rmdiv) \overset{\rmdiv}{\longrightarrow} H^{1}$ constructed from a new FDM basis for $H^{2} \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} H^{1}$.
        \item  A subcomplex of the standard, non-conforming $H(\rmdiv) \overset{\rmdiv}{\longrightarrow} L^{2}$ constructed from the same basis, such that the non-conforming contributions do not shoot up the density- Pablo's done similar things to this using the FDM CG basis as a basis for DG when using non-conforming DG schemes.
    \end{itemize}}
